# Heart Disease Prediction

For my first project for the NYC Data Science Academy Data Science with Machine Learning Bootcamp I've chosen to analyze the [Heart Failure Prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) from kaggle.com

As the leading cause of death worldwide, there is significant interest in being able to accurately predict a patient's risk for developing heart disase.[(1)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death) 

This dataset has compiled patient information from four hospitals and is the largest dataset publicly available to-date for research into heart disease risk. In this repository we have carried out an exploratory data analysis of this dataset and applied machine learning models to accurately predict heart disease risk.
